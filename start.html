	</header>

<p>Welcome! Before you create your account, please take a moment to review the the following document, which explains the course itself as well as this website.

<p>First, note that you will <em>not</em> be using Blackboard in this course, except for discussions (which are not required). All course materials will be found on the website you are reading now, and all homework problems will be submitted through this website as well.

<p>This course is divided into 15 weeks, and each week will have an online homework assignment. Your grade will be based exclusively on these homework assignments. No tests, no papers, no (graded) discussions. Homework is due each Wednesday, starting with week 2.</p>

<p>You will do the homework assignments online, with special web-based software designed for this purpose. The software is highly interactive; it gives you feedback as you go.</p>

<h3>The Course Website</h3>

<p>To use this website, you need to create an account. You simply have to enter your name, your UIS email address, and a password of your choosing. This is <em>not</em> the same as your UIS password; it is specific to this course.

<p>The only reason you are required to create an account is security. Your account identifies you as the rightful owner of your homework and gives you access to your grades, and it is important that only you have this access.

<p>Also, the course website is a completely non-commercial product. You don't have to worry about it gathering information about you and selling it to a company.

<p>Once you complete the account creation process, you will be taken to the main access point for the course. This page will contain links to all the lessons and homework assignments. It also doubles as a gradebook, so that you can track your progress through the course. The best way to learn your way around is to jump in and read the first lesson.

<h3>Expectations and Grading</h3>

<p>All homework due dates are listed on the course's main access point, but in general, the homework for a given week is due the Wednesday of the </em>following</em> week. You'll be able to see the results once I grade your homework, and I grade the homework for a given week all at once, <b>after</b> the due date has passed. So if you turn in your homework a week early, for example, I won't get to it until <em>at least</em> one week later. In general, I try to keep the turn-around time short. In a worst case &mdash; if I am unusually busy, say, or out of town for a conference &mdash; it may take me up to a week to get to your homework. If I take any longer than that, please feel free to drop me an email, since it may indicate that something has gone wrong. The most common problem is that a student thinks they have submitted an exercise, but it turns out they haven't. If this happens, or you don't see your grade for some reason, don't stew over it for weeks: let me know!</p>

<p>As noted earlier, your grade is based entirely on your weekly homework assignments. Each is graded on a 100-point scale, so there are 1500 points possible. Your grade is based on the number of points you earn, in the customary way. So, for example, if you earn 85% of points possible &mdash; i.e., 1275 out of a possible 1500 &mdash; then your grade for the course will be B. I reserve the right to exercise some discretion in the assignment of final grades, however (i.e., I can increase your grade in a borderline case).</p>

<h3>Late Submission</h3>

<p>In general, I expect you to turn in your homework by the specified due date. Late submission may result in points deducted. Having said that, it is <b>far better</b> to turn in a homework late than not at all. The due dates, while important, are there for your benefit, not mine.</p>

<p>When you submit homework late, I will grade it when I do my weekly round of grading. For example, if you turn in an assignment on Friday that was due Wednesday, and I happen to have graded that assignment on Thursday, I won't grade your late submission until I grade the <em>following</em> week's assignment.</p>

<h3>Where Are My Grades?</h3>

<p>As explained earlier, the course website's main page doubles as a gradebook. This is actually a <em>far better</em> arrangement than Blackboard's built in gradebook (which you would normally access by clicking "My Grades" in Blackboard). For this reason, I will not be keeping the Blackboard gradebook up to date.

<h3>Contacting Me</h3>

<p>Feel free to contact me any time, either for help with the material or for technical assistance with any aspect of the course website. If there's a technical glitch, I can generally fix it. Don't be shy about this: while the courseware has been tested, the only way I can truly know if it's working for you is if you tell me.</p>

<p>Preferred methods of contacting me are email and the discussion board on Blackboard. You can generally expect me to respond to an email within one working day. If you catch me within working hours (9:00-5:00 Monday-Friday, central time), I usually respond fairly quickly; just be aware that since I have meetings, other classes, etc., I cannot respond instantly. I will also monitor the discussion board, but in general you can expect a faster response to an email. My email address is <a href="mailto:jbark3@uis.edu">jbark3@uis.edu</a>.</p>

<h3>Discussion Board</h3>

<p>This is a bit of an unusual online class in that there is no required discussion. The reason for this is that you already have weekly homework assignments, and a weekly required discussion on top of that would be a bit much.</p>

<p>However, I do have a discussion board set up for <em>voluntary</em> discussions, and I will monitor it and respond if appropriate. That way, students can help each other, and/or pose questions of general interest to the class.</p>

<h3>Special Note on the Website</h3>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, this course has interactive elements. This is especially true for the homework assignments, but the lessons themselves often have interactive elements. For this reason, I recommend reading the lessons on-screen, instead of printing them out. At least, read the lessons through once, working on the interactive elements as you go.</p>

<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>

<p>To take this course, you need to have access to a computer that is capable of running the course software. This should generally not be a problem, but there are a couple potential issues to be aware of.</p>

<p>The website has been tested on recent versions of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. It <em>should</em> run on any modern browser, meaning: Internet Explorer 10 or later, Microsoft Edge, or any version of Safari, Firefox or Chrome that was released in the last few years. If you find that your preferred browser is not well supported, however, you always have the option of installing Chrome or Firefox. You can use the following links to download <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Chrome</a>.</p>

<p>The website will most definitely <em>not</em> work with older (&lt; 10) versions of Internet Explorer. If you are using an older version of Internet Explorer, you really need to upgrade anyway.

<p>You also need to have JavaScript and cookies enabled. This is the default setting on every browser anyway, so this shouldn't be an issue. (Some people disable disable Javascript and/or cookies out of security or privacy concerns. While these concerns are understandable, it just isn't technically possible for this website to work without them enabled.)

<p>Finally, while the website should work on nearly any computer, it will not (yet) work correctly on a phone or tablet.</p>

<h3>OK, I'm ready to create my account</h3>
